Udacity - How to Use Git and GitHub (Jan 2015)

Course Summary

Effective use of version control is an important and useful skill for any developer working on long-lived 
(or even medium-lived) projects, especially if more than one developer is involved. This course, built with
input from GitHub, will introduce the basics of using version control by focusing on a particular version 
control system called Git and a collaboration platform called GitHub.
